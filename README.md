# Refactoring-practice.

The smelly code and refactored code are found in different branches, as follows.

## general: 
  Contains code that is very similar to what martin fowler had in his book, but its compilable. This branch contains hints and the name for each of the style of refactoring. For copyright reasons I have a complete set of different code are kept. If you have not purchased the book, I highly recoment the book.
  The code packaged into the name of the smell.For example `com.aneonoir.longmethod` `com.aneonoir.longclass`

## general-no-hints:
  Same smelly code but there is not hints provided. Once you have refactored you can find the solution in the general-solution branch.

## general-solution: 
  Contains the solution to the smells present in the general branch.

## diverse: 
  Contains smelly code that is taken from the projects or code I have practised myself. It contains hints to fix.
## diverse-solution:
  Contains refactors for diverse branch.
